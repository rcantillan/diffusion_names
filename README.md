# Project: Diffusion of names and social class

This repository contains code routines for the "diffusion of names and social classes in Chile" project. In the first instance, the code develops routines to:

- Extract and relate historical data on the socioeconomic composition of the communes of Chile using census data and other alternative sources.

- Carry out descriptive analysis and modeling (based on Social Network Analysis) that account for historical stratification trends.
